% Land Use section
\section{Land Use}\label{sec:landuse}
Fifteen land use types are available to choose from in PEWI, including perennial and annual legumes, annual grains, mixed fruit and vegetables, pasture, herbaceous perennials, and woody perennials.

% sub section
\subsection{Conventional Corn}
Corn is an annual grain crop traditionally used for food, animal feed, and biofuel. Corn is currently the most planted field crop in the US, with over 36.4 million hectares (90 million acres) of corn planted every year\cite{1}.  In PEWI, conventional corn land cover assumes conventional tillage and management.

\subsection{Conventional Soy}
Soybeans are an annual nitrogen-fixing legume crop traditionally used for oil, animal feed, food, and industrial products. Soybeans are currently the second-most planted field crop in the US, with 31.4 million hectares (77.5 million acres) of soybeans planted every year\cite{2}.  In PEWI, conventional soybean land cover assumes conventional tillage and management.

\subsection{Conservation Corn}
Corn is an annual grain crop traditionally used for food, animal feed, and biofuel. Corn is currently the most planted field crop in the US, with over 36.4 million hectares (90 million acres) of corn planted every year\cite{3}.  In PEWI, conservation management assumes use of "no-till," cover crops, grassed waterways and/or buffers, as well as contouring and/or terracing where appropriate to the location (i.e. downhill slopes above 2\% elevation grade).

\subsection{Conservation Soy}
Soybeans are an annual nitrogen-fixing legume crop traditionally used for oil, animal feed, food, and industrial products. Soybeans are currently the second-most planted field crop in the US, with 31.4 million hectares (77.5 million acres) of soybeans planted every year\cite{4}.  As legumes, they fix nitrogen (N2) from the atmosphere, converting it into plant-available ammonia (NH3). Conservation management assumes use of "no-till," cover crops, grassed waterways, and/or buffers, as well as contouring and/or terracing where appropriate to the location.

\subsection{Alfalfa}
Alfalfa is perennial legume traditionally hayed and used as forage for livestock. Approximately 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) of alfalfa are harvested in the U.S. each year\cite{5}.  On average, three to five cuttings can be taken per year.

\subsection{Mixed Fruit and Vegetables}
The mixed fruit and vegetable land cover in PEWI is based on an equal distribution of four crops: strawberries, grapes, green beans, and squash. Mixed fruit and vegetable land cover in PEWI assumes effective management practices as noted by Taber.

\subsection{Grass Hay}
Grass hay is a perennial crop traditionally grown and bailed for livestock feed. Over 15 million hectares (38 million acres) of hay, excluding alfalfa hay, are harvested annually in the United States. On average, three cuttings can be taken per year.

\subsection{Switchgrass}
Switchgrass is a native, herbaceous, low-input perennial crop that can be harvested for biofuel. It is adaptable to many soil types.

\subsection{Permanent Pasture}
Permanent pasture in PEWI is alfalfa or grass hay grazed by cattle for the typical 200 day grazing season from April 15 to November 1.\cite{10}

\subsection{Rotational Grazing}
Rotational grazing is alfalfa or grass hay grazed by cattle for the typical 200 day grazing season from April 15 to November 1, strategically rotated across paddocks for even grazing.\cite{11}

% Physical Features section
\newpage
\section{Physical Features}\label{sec:physicalfeatures}
In the Physical Features tab, you'll find information on topography, soil properties, subwatershed boundaries, and strategic wetland areas. These properties can help you strategize the placement of land uses. Physical features influence the Ecosystem Services gained from each land cover choice, from soil and water quality improvement to yield.

% sub section
\subsection{Topographic Relief}
This feature shows the elevation grade, or slope, of each cell of PEWI. Land use covers perform differently under different elevations, and the topographic map can help explain results and inform location-specific land use choices. The lightest color represents the shallowest slope, and the darkest color represents the steepest slope.

% Precipitation section
\newpage
\section{Precipitation}
Precipitation is based on historical annual precipitation data from Iowa to simulate climate variability. Scenarios are broken into three categories.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Dry category includes the 62.4 cm/yr (24.58 in/yr) scenario, with a probability of 5\%, and the 71.6 cm/yr (28.18 in/yr) scenario, with a probability of 15\%.
  \item The Normal category includes the 77.2 cm/yr (30.39 in/yr) scenario, with a probability of 15\%, the 81.7 cm/yr (32.16 in/yr) scenario, with a probability of 15\%, and the 87.2 cm/yr (34.34 in/yr) scenario, with a probability of 15\%.
  \item The Wet category includes the 92.6 cm/yr (36.47 in/yr) scenario, with a probability of 15\%, and the 114.6 cm/yr (45.1 in/yr) scenario, with a probability of 5\%.
\end{itemize}

In PEWI, the level of precipitation influences water quality and soil quality metrics including nitrate and phosphorus runoff, gross erosion, and sediment transport. This is because improved water flow carries a greater quantity of soil and nutrients downstream. Extremes in precipitation also decrease yield for annual crops, mixed fruits and vegetables, alfalfa, grass hay, switchgrass, permanent pasture, and rotational grazing.\cite{33}  Calculations for yield for each land use can be found in the corresponding yield tab.
